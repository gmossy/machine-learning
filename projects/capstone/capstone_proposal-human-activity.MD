## Proposal - A Machine Learning Based Human Activity Recognizer.
### Domain Background
The goal of activity recognition is to recognize common human activities in real life settings. Human activity recognition (HAR) plays an important role in people’s daily life for its competence in learning profound high-level knowledge about human activity from raw sensor inputs. [1]  We seek to use novel data mining and machine learning techniques to model and then predict a wide range of human activities.  

Human Activity Recognition have a very wide applications ranging from security-related applications, logistics support, location-based services and that health applications by helping handicapped or elderly people to live more independently, rate health levels, activate household controls, appliances and provide safety. With this knowledge from the model, this can be used to perform Ambient Assisted Living.  HAR is very multifaceted, useful many fields and may be referred to as goal recognition, behavior recognition, location estimation and others. 

Human Activity Recognition aims to identify the actions carried out by a person provided by a set of observations from the person's movements and surrounding environment, and then model a wide range of human activities. Recognition can be accomplished by exploiting the information retrieved from various sources such as body-worn sensors.  It is believed that by empowering computer monitoring to monitor the behavior of agents then these computers would become suited to act on our behalf. 
 
This project is based on sensor that are based on accelerometers, but many additional sensors, such as microphones, motion video capture, human vital signs could be later added to this project in order to capture data to provide features to the model that would improve the accuracy, provide better models, and increase the number of activities that can be understood, with the ultimate goal of providing a real-time prediction of each and every activity that the person is doing.

My interest in this field stems from my work with AT&T Public sector where I am a Senior Solutions Architect providing technical leadership on Technology Innovation initiatives for our Nations Department of Defense, DISA, Army and Cyber programs.  In this role I support multi-vendor, high risk/reward integration projects, including rapid software development, enterprise networking and automation that enables business processes, and provides operations automation. I have participated in AT&T Software Symposium Hackathons in which the project was to provide assisted living support to wheelchair bound, severely disabled patients.  I am also an adjunct instruction at Frederick Community College teaching students how to program Arduino microcontrollers and sensors to interact with the physical environment. 

### Problem Statement
Human Activity Recognition or HAR for short, is the problem of predicting what a person is doing based on a time series recording of their movement using sensors. In this project the sensors will be tri-axis accelerometers.  The idea is that once the subject’s activity is recognized and known, it can be saved in a model that can then be used to recognize future those activities with high accuracy when applied, and then provide useful assistance with the result. 

Movements that we will study in this project will be normal indoor activities such as standing, sitting, jumping, and going up stairs. Sensors are often located on the subject such as a smartphone or vest and often record accelerometer data in three dimensions (x, y, z).
In this project we explore the results of the ability for a model to identify a user is performing—a task or activity they are doing by use of a sensor, the accelerometer, this is referred to as activity recognition. 

It is a challenging problem because there is no clear analytical way to relate the sensor data to specific actions in a general way. It is technically challenging because of the large volume of sensor data collected (e.g. tens or hundreds of observations per second) and the classical use of hand crafted features and heuristics from this data in developing predictive models.

Classical approaches to the problem involve hand crafting features from the time series data based on fixed-size windows and training machine learning models, such as ensembles of decision trees. The difficulty is that this feature engineering requires deep expertise in the field.

### Solution Statement
Recently, deep learning methods such as recurrent neural networks and one-dimensional convolutional neural networks or CNNs have been shown to provide state-of-the-art results on challenging activity recognition tasks with little or no data feature engineering.
The solution seeks to achieve very good results with classification accuracy of human activities recognition first using traditional supervised learning models using classification algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, then trying an artificial neural network (ANN). Models will be built and then used to infer the activity from test data.  The accuracy will be evaluated. 

### Benchmark Model
A benchmark model is a threshold or goal that you're trying to beat with your solution. For most projects you should choose a simple model (something different than your solution). You'd train/test the benchmark model using the same data and conditions as your solution. This allows you to make a clear, objective comparison between the benchmark model and your solution.
For example, a logistic regression model might be a good benchmark model for a classification problem.

### Evaluation Metrics
The objective of this project is to predict the activity performed by the subject accurately, based on accelerometer readings, so, Validation Misclassification rate is chosen as the Assessment Measure to compare the performance of different models. 

### Project Design
To develop an activity recognition model, we will make use of the tri-axial accelerometer sensor data that was collected and labeled from thirty users as they performed daily activities such as walking, jogging, climbing stairs, sitting, and standing.  
This time series data was then aggregated into examples that summarize the user activity. Supervised learning will be used to train the data and validation methods will be used to create a models 


The resulting training data will be usedusing supervised learning to induce a deep learning model for activity recognition.

8.	Approaches to Modeling the Problem
- Our experiments first require us to collect the labeled raw accelerometer data and then transform that data into examples
- we divided the data into 10-second segments and then generated features that were based on the 200 readings contained
within each 10-second segment. 
- Next we generated informative features based on the 200 raw accelerometer readings, where each reading contained an x, y, and z value corresponding to the three axes/dimensions 
- which is subsequently used for training and testing

The solution then proposes a convolutional neural network designed to take a

The workflow for the solution is as follows:
#### Collect
1. Prepare training set and test set for malware and benign respectively
2. Select features (which will be the printable strings) from datasets, and convert them to feature vectors
#### Extract
3. Provide a hashing function to tokenize or compress the strings, this will reduce the features. 
4. Extract all the feature vectors. 
5. Create a generator to break the data to be trained into batches. 
#### Explore
6. Explore my data to show the distribution information of the dataset. Work will be done to classify the files into malware families
 using a classifier from sklearn such as DecisionTrees,RandomForestClassifier or SVM. 
#### Train
7. Decide on a classifier that will be used for the CNN.
8. Split the data into Training and Test sets.
9. Train the data and validate then and create and save the best model.
#### Test
10. Test the trained model.  First take and scan the Test data file, and collect it's features, get the feature vector, and then test the feature vector against the trained classifier model obtaining the class prediction.  The classifier outputs the class prediction {benign, malicious} of the test file. 
#### Evaluate
11. Finally, use the Test data results to evaluate the performance with a ROC curve. The raw classifier output (i.e., probability distribution) will be used to compute the average accuracy, false positive and false negative rate, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) graphs Score and compute and ROC Curve.
